# Cost Analysis

## Important Information
As this tool spins up cloud resources, it will result in charges to your Azure account.  Efforts have been made to minimize the costs incurred, but the tool author is not responsible for any charges or security issues that may result from usage of this tool.

## Cost Analysis
